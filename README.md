##  Python Flask based webserver running on your Pi

This Repository contains all the code for all the Practicals and Tutorial we did for EEE3096s.

The Code for the Python Flask based Webserver is found on the Python_Flask_Based_Webserver [folder-link] folder above.

This project simply serves up `Hello World! Meet 👨‍💻Wavhudi(MLDWAV001) and 👨‍💻Zolile(MDNAVE001)` on port `:80` of your balena device.

<!-- To get this project up and running, you will need to signup for a balena account [here][signup-page] and set up a device, have a look at our [Getting Started tutorial][gettingStarted-link]. Once you are set up with balena, you will need to clone this repo locally: 
```
$ git clone git@github.com:balena-projects/simple-server-python.git
```
Then add your balena application's remote:
```
$ git remote add balena username@git.balena-cloud.com:username/myapp.git
```
and push the code to the newly added remote:
```
$ git push balena master
```
It should take a few minutes for the code to push. While you wait, lets enable device URLs so we can see the server outside of our local network. This option can be toggled on the device summary page, pictured below or in the `Actions` tab in your device dashboards.

Once the device is updated, you should see this in your logs:
